This code is designed to be copy and pasted into the node console.  It will also work in Chrome inspector's console, though if you copy and paste the whole thing you'll only get the last result.  If you want to run it in Chrome, either copy and paste it line by line or copy and paste the whole thing and then try accessing the variables you're interested in.
